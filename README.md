# gala-planner
An app I'm designing for a friend to help her set tables more easily during gala planning. It will allow the gala planner to create tables, set a menu, and allow the table sponsor to invite guests who will respond to their invitations.
It's still in development, but I'm adding more to the project every day. I used Python and Django for this project.
